			title: "Why is the sky blue?",
			content: "Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time.",

			title: "How do airplanes stay up?",
			content: "According to Scientific American, airplanes stay up because wings push air down, which causes the air to push back up with an equal and opposite force, called lift. This applies to wings of any shape, curved or flat, symmetrical or not.",
